The module can compile standalone:

 cd main; go build main.go

And as part of common binary

When module compiled standalone - it init multiex module, but it is work or have any effect - Main function called directly
from main function im main package.

main.go for standalone compile is simple and universal and can be apply for every utility without modifications.
It do only call Main functin from parent package.
